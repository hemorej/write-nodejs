todo:

- config for hostname instead of port
- experiment with unload/beforeunload to save last work
- login user before anthg happens
	- login page: sessions, cookies (mongo?)
	- guest ? use current func, user ? use dropbox
	- use sessions instead of socket ID to resume work after reconnect
- detect if some js resources didn't load
- break into proper modules
- save to dropbox button
